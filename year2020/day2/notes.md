PART ONE:
more difficult
it was probably beacause I never did any file manilpulation with
python and this was my first time, especially since this file 
was even bigger than the last and manual work was not an option

although it was still fun

PART TWO
now that i am more familair with opening and closing files it wasn't so 
bad, just a little confusing cause there was a lot to keep track of

still not sure how clean to wrtie my code tho because I just want to 
finish as fast as possible, with the first day it wasn't a problem
because it was short enought to keep track of
