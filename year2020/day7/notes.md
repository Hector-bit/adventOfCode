Day 7 PART 1:
So far there are a lot of rules and I still haven't gotten to the part of what im suppose to do.
confusing so imma organise my thoughts and rules here

So for this problem I get a list of rules and I need to figure out how to organise those rules in order to figure
out how many bags can hold at least one shiny gold bag, I feel like recursion might be easier here, idk yet

no recursion just a dictionary, we can hold more than one value for a dictionary useing an array as the key!

so that was kinda hard, just made a dumb mistake by assuming that there were no repeats of the values to the main bag key
it just slipped past me like a pig covered in oil

Day 7 PART 2:

this problem is just the reverse of what I just did for part one, so easy? maybe lets see if I can do it in less than half an hour...
 
ok took me more like 2 hours but either way it wasn't as bad as part 1

plus my code is fairly neat
