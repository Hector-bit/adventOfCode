advent of code day3:
Just learning vim at the moment, pretty cool so far

Part One:
I made a lot of dumb mistakes at the begginning like not reusing the 
forest array given to continue all the way to the bottom. I then had
trouble with indexing at wrong places and not being able to count how 
many characters where in each string which messed my up

overall not very hard just dumb mistakes, hopefully theres no part two

Part Two:
Well god damn it, i had to get help from reddit but i now understand my
mistake. It was the skip two at a time slope that was giving me 
trouble. The problem was that I was not going right by 1, but instead 2.
So my slope was 2,2 not 1,2. Dumb mistake to be stuck on, but oh well
