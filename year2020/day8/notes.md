hello day 8 Part 1!
starting to get the hang of this and now I just want to smash through today and 9 in the same day

we are going to througn infinite and and returning a counter, seems pretty easy

ok part 1 is done and my mistake was not figuring out how too close a recursive function once 
I hit a repeat, not closing it meant the rest of branches still did their thing and i had to dig
through all the console.logs to find the first instance of a repeat along with its accumalator

note: I hate recursion

DAY 8 PART 2:

Even easier!!! like 5 minutes easy. didn't even to write code
just printed the last index that was causing problems and changed it lol
