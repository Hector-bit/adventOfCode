Day 13
Part one --
    it looks pretty easy, i just have to search for the first bus after a given time, the only weird
    part is that it doesn't give me time stamps

    ok now I get it, I have to figure out the buses next stop and then take the earlist one

    yeah, part one was pretty easy

Part two -- 
    I hate this part so much, I think this is the longest I have ever taken on a problem,
    I couldn't get my original code to run and as a punishment I will learn the CRT in order
    to nail this type of problem in to my head but the thing is that there is a lot to learn 
    First:
        the CRT uses modular math which I don't any of beside what mod does
    Second:
        I have to learn about how to get the inverse of a mod, which I didn't 
        know was a thing up until now
    Third:
        I don't know how to implement this kind of thing
    
    I had to look up a solution because I couldn't figure out how to 
    implement the CRT and I also didn't fully comprehend how it works
