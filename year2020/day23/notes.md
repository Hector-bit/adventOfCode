Day 23:
	Part One:
		The crab plays a game where he manipulates a circle of numbers
		After he does his rules on the numbers for x amount of times
		I am suppose to return a string of numbers going clockwise from 1 (excluding the number 1)

		Not so bad, but that only means that part 2 is going to kick my butt
	Part Two:
		Ok so the crab is now playing this game with ONE MILLION CUPS ON A TINY RAFT
