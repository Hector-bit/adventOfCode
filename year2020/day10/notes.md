Day 10 Part 1:

weird one but I think it will be straightfoward enough
they are being nice by just letter use the following valid adapter

pretty easy there was just a weird caveate where the last three difference
adapter was not in the array but just automatically added at the end

Day 10 Part 2:
not sure if the problems are getting easier of if im just getting that much better
but im loving it, feel so cool rn

this one is just mean, i take back what i said in part one
I hate to find all possible combinations of adapters 

ok maybe easier than I thought, I don't need to create every permutation and instead
I can start substracting until I can't make any valid arrays then return a counter

Overall I had to find a solution on reddit, big sad but it saved me a lot of time because
this part could not be solved with a brute force solution, you had to find a trick. Here I 
had to group up the differnces of ones betweens threes and then multiply the possible 
combinations between them if that makes sense, hopefully I will never read these again
