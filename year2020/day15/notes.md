Day15 
    Part One:
        I don't get it yet, im suppose to understand a pattern, then produce a future output
        The dataset is really small this time though, its only 5 lines.

    Part Two:
        I did the same thing as I did in part one except I used a dictionary(python hashmap equivalent)
        instead of an array. Overall I did the same thing but faster.
