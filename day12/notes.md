Day 12: Rain Risk
Part 1 -
    we have a ship and instructions, we take the sum of the starting position and final position
    sounds pretty easy tbh

    Wasn't too hard, just a lot of cases that I had to handle

Part 2 -
    couldn't do it, sucks but i worked on it for too long.
    either way imma understand how they did it

Notes for part 2:
they have waypoint coordinates and boat coordinates and the code is short
then they for loop through each line and cmd = the instructions while
n = to the number for each instruction

each change for the waypoint is simple, just look at the instruction,
N, S, W, E then add or subtract to the waypoint coordinate

the F(forward) instruction is also straightforward

the hard part for me and even while reading the solution code are the 
Left and Right rotations. 

ok so the rotation can be written down into two if statements and
its easyi to read so idk

Ok so after taking some time I was able to make my original code work but I still needed help, so this makes it
like the third time I had to look up a solution
