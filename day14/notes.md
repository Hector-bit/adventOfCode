Day 14
    Part One:
        Ok so here we are doing some computer science stuff that I have forgotten
        Step one: understand the problem
            My puzzle piece is something called an initialization program, and I can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory.
            Both values and memory addresses are 36-bit unsigned integers.
            Bitmasks are given to me as a 'string' of 36 bits (0 or 1, just incase you forget)

            ok to bit masks git priority and so the values of the incoming byte is only put in if the value is null 'x'

            that took way too long and im not very proud of myself, oh well at least im getting back into the rythm of things
    
    Part Two:
        Confusing so, I still don't understand the problem so imma keep reading
