Day 19:
    Part 1:
        It took me so many rereads to understand what the problem wants me to do
        So each message has to pass a set of rules, and I am suppose to return how many messages pass those rules
        I have two approaches here
            Approach one is where I create every acceptable permutation and see how many match the messages
            Approach Two is where I check as I go
        I am going with the second approach as it seems like the faster one
