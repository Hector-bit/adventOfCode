Day6 PART 1:
So far i still hate using qwerty, but other than that I didn't have that bad of a time 
coming up with a soluion. Although I was a bit distracted i guess
not sure but now I feel like im getting into the groove of this

psudo: I just put each group into a array and made sure not to add repeats to the array
then I counted the length and added it to a counter, overall somewhat easy

again the hardest part is parsing the data

Day6 PART 2:
Got a little more complicated, but I think I can use a dictionary to help me out here

not terrible, I was to too confused as to why the counted exceeded the line of data, when
it wasn't a problem
