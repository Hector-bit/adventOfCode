Day 5 part 1:
For this one I am going to try and be organized by keeping
everything in just one file, wish my sanity goodluck

wasn't terrible but i feel like i took too long
either way I feel like i did what i wanted to do
 - compartamentalize my code more and keep it on one python file

 Day 5 part 2:
 Figuring out what the question wanted took longer than writing
 the code
 Felt pretty good about this one
 So far day 4 was the hardest and now my ego is the size of an elephant
