Day 1 solution:
counting:
    if 6 or less don't count
    if 7 look for pid, if missing continue
    if 8 count

first part wasn't so bad, I just needed to take it slow
and think about how I wanted to parse my data

Day 2 solution:
This one fucking sucks, I have to do more data parsing and I
have to parse a string that has numbers (which need to be 
read as numbers) and letters (that need to be read as 
letters), im starting to hate adventOfCode

Had to use somebody else code but either way I still had to read
and then fix it because it had issues, i'm just glad to be done with it.
That sucked but at least im at day 5
