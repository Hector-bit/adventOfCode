Day 11 part 1
ok this day is pretty straightfoward
im just gonna apply some rules to a 2d map of arrays, learned a lot about this form lambda

so far this has taken the longest, not the hardest tho, just tideous i guess, anyways i wrote more checks and hopefullly 
tommorrow i will finish part 1

took for fricking everrrrrrrrrrrr, but i got eventually, and on my own so im somewhat proud

Day 11 part 2
Better be easier, nope even harder i guess

not as bad, but still took longer than it should have because i didn't add return to the 
recursive call, so that's why i was getting a bunch of nones in my results which didn't 
count towards my seats being "#" or "L"
