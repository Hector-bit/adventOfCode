Day 16:
    -Part One-
        This data sucks:
        So right away I hate the data we are given, its god awful
        It has a bunch of transportation information, and then my ticket, and then other peopls tickets

        Manual work:
        I will remove some text and just use the "nearby tickets:" group of data

        I didn't write the most dynamic code but I got part one done pretty quickly
