Day 14
    Part One:
        Ok so here we are doing some computer science stuff that I have forgotten
        Step one: understand the problem
            My puzzle piece is something called an initialization program, and I can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory.
            Both values and memory addresses are 36-bit unsigned integers.
            Bitmasks are given to me as a 'string' of 36 bits (0 or 1, just incase you forget)
