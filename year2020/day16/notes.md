Day 16:
    -Part One-
        This data sucks:
        So right away I hate the data we are given, its god awful
        It has a bunch of transportation information, and then my ticket, and then other peopls tickets

        Manual work:
        I will remove some text and just use the "nearby tickets:" group of data

        I didn't write the most dynamic code but I got part one done pretty quickly

    -Part Two-
        So for part two I need to find out which number belongs to which field

        ok, so i have to discard the tickets that contain an invalid number, and create a new list from the valid ones

        There may potentially have been some faulty data or I missdid something, idk

        Either way I did the last stretch of figuring out which dictionary belonged
        to which fields and it worked
